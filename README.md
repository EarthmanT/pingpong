pingpong
========

A Ping Pong Server for test and benchmarking purposes.

The intended usage of this package is to run two hosts. Host 1 runs a ping server questioning a pong server (on host 2) for the answer. Ping and pong build a very simple distributed system.



Siege <-> __Ping (Host 1) <-> Pong (Host 2)__
